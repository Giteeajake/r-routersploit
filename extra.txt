Required Signature

The module must contain this exact public async function:

pub async fn run(target: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>

Or any variant like:

pub async fn run(_target: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>

Or even:

pub async fn run(host: &str) -> anyhow::Result<()>


Refactor this module to work with the auto-dispatch system. Do not remove any functionality or features. Make sure it defines a pub async fn run(target: &str) -> Result<()> entry point that internally calls the correct logic. Rename any conflicting functions if needed, but preserve all capabilities and structure.


Refactor this code to a Rust module  so that it fully integrates into my RouterSploit-inspired Rust auto-dispatch framework.

    âœ… Preserve all functionality and existing logic â€” do not remove or simplify any capabilities.

    âœ… Ensure the module defines a pub async fn run(target: &str) -> Result<()> entry point.

        All internal logic must be routed through this function.

    âœ… If any internal function is named run and conflicts with the dispatch entry, rename it (e.g. to execute, exploit, etc.) â€” but do not change logic.

    âœ… The module must compile, follow anyhow::Result<()>, and use proper error propagation (? operator).

    âœ… Do not add placeholders, pseudocode, or stubs â€” this must be real working Rust code.

    âœ… Use async/await and retain all networking, parsing, and exploit behavior from the original logic.

    âœ… Keep the code idiomatic and modular â€” preserve structure, variable naming, and async HTTP usage.

    âœ… If necessary, clean up variable scoping or imports, but never remove real features.

    âœ… keep all comments from the orginal but add two / before comments

    âœ… only use the poc and it must be a 1 to 1 convertion

Here is the original module that needs to be refactored:
























Would you like a Dynamic/Auto-Scaler version too? ðŸš€
(Example: start at 500 concurrency, grow to 5000 if CPU/RAM is good.)

Want me to show it too? ðŸ”¥
You said:
yes Dynamic/Auto-Scaler  show function to add
